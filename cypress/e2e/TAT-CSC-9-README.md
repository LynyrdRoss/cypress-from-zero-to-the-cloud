# Cypress, from Zero to the Cloud

Cypress scripts that I created from each of the lessons in the course

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> Node version is v16.14.2 at the time of writing these scripts

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode.

Or `npm run cy:run` to run the Cypress tests in headless mode.

If you want to simulate in mobile version, you may do so with `cy:open:mobile`

## This was a GREAT experience!
